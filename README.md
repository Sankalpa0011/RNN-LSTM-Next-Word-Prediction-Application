## Introduction
This project is designed to predict the next word in a text sequence using an RNN-LSTM model. It can be used to enhance typing experiences, autocomplete text, and improve various natural language processing (NLP) applications.

## Features
- Predicts the next word in a sequence
- Utilizes RNN and LSTM for accurate predictions
- Easy-to-use interface
- Customizable and extensible

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/RNN-LSTM-Next-Word-Prediction.git
    cd RNN-LSTM-Next-Word-Prediction
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Train the model by running the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook RNN_LSTM_Next_Word_Prediction_Application.ipynb
    ```
3. Use the trained model to predict the next word in a text sequence.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model should be a text file containing sequences of words. Ensure the data is clean and preprocessed before training.

## Model Architecture
The model uses a Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM layers to capture the temporal dependencies in the text data. The architecture can be customized to improve performance based on the specific use case.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss. Detailed results and plots can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
